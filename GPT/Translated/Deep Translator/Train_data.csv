sadness,"Even though I wash my face every time I go to bed. I do regular skin care. But every time I have my period, one or two pimples definitely appear.

anger,"Why does this seem like Via Vallen versus Persija? This is Women versus Sexual Harassment, oi. Don't make it seem like Persija supports sexual harassment. Simic is indeed reckless and deserves punishment, but I'm sure his football career won't be disturbed. Uno is still the Deputy Governor, right?"
sadness,"Only in the comics haha ​​yeah hahaha. Cough Mrs. Aji, aha cough. Lonely without you."
sadness,"[USERNAME] [USERNAME] [USERNAME] Yes. Because the effects after speaking up are varied, and more people are falling for what I see now and that is actually eroding the mentality. Maybe those who say speak up are exaggerating etc. their mentality is mentally weak."
sadness,"I've been crying since earlier seeing the photo of Taehyung who has removed his mullet. Does he know that many people don't like his mullet?

anger,[@USERNAME] Don't let saving the campus be a reason to keep terrorists in this country. The Chief of Police should offer Fachmi Hamzah and Fachrizal Zuliansyah to be at the forefront of raiding terrorists so they can feel the tension when it happens. Activists are nothing if not.

sadness,"When we see young children who are fire victims, their environment is not supportive. Their younger siblings were really like being bold with their elders, with no manners. Seeing conditions like that, some say that today's children are really stubborn. Nothing, if their environment is good that's definitely not the case."
fear,"But if you look into it again... oh my god, you have to be prepared for this and that, it's hard to be a seed, whatever. You haven't even graduated from college, and you're thinking about that... too visionary, bro."

love,"What pity? It's so very very very very hard to express it. And it's so much pity, not like a fan to an idol, but like to a sibling, like to a younger sibling, like to a child too and I'm very willing."
happy,"It's viral, right? So that everyone knows that the Indonesian government's economy is indeed better led by Djokowi.. keep up the spirit guys [URL]"
anger,[USERNAME] [USERNAME] Only a feces-brained person like you would say that Jakarta is better now! That's why judging something must be far from self-interest!

anger,"A very trendy topic, pros and cons are natural, but the comments my boss made were just looking for attention and exaggerating, even blaming and assuming that it was the dangdut dance that was wrong, you should probably check the position of your brain and butt, maybe they are mixed up, your brain is full of shit. #viaVallen"

sadness,"Or they don't even know about the existence of such modern food. Just looking at it, I can imagine how many days of work it would take to pay for it, let alone eat it. Honey.... I want to be like them. But I can't. I've been hit by the modern syndrome."
anger,Twitter: [USERNAME] [USERNAME] One vote for five years. Don't expect our votes if the council supports the dissolution of the KPK. Better to disband the DPR!

sadness,"Souma is finished, yowamushi is finished. Now watching anime that has been downloaded for a long time but has not been watched at all. I'm mega bored with Korean dramas."
fear,"Why not seek treatment? Simple, afraid that one day I will SNAP and then OD. Now I still feel afraid even when I see sharp objects, afraid that I will suddenly do something strange."
happy,"So yeah, after four years, we finally published our own short story collection together. The title is #TSYGMC. This book is published by [USERNAME] in physical and e-book formats. #WorkshopCerpenKompas2014 [URL]"
anger,"[USERNAME] If you lose, you lose your reputation, this is what happens, just saying random things, weakening someone, creating hate speech, spreading HOAX news, etc. It is not fitting for someone who is said to be a national figure in this country, his speech is always wrong."
sadness,"Yesterday, I really gave up on the dastan. Seven materials and quiz questions. I only studied the quizzes, and the rest I just read and didn't put any thought into. I really only relied on prayer, surrendering. I even got a real headache because of the flu. When I got the questions and knew what they were, I wanted to cry."
anger,"We are not allowed to pray in all places, one of which is in buildings built for disbelief (one of which is a church)."
sadness,"Thank you, I hope those who have dengue fever get well soon."
happy,Congratulations [USERNAME] may it go smoothly and get the chance to see the people on stage [USERNAME] Break a leg!!! [URL]
happy,"So cute. I really like seeing the greeting, so adorable. Come closer to me, honey! Oh yeah, don't forget to share chicken with me, thank you."
anger,I just thought that as long as she smiled it meant she was happy. I never thought that she was trying so hard to survive in it. Very very selfish right? Qyara I hope in the future you don't meet someone like me because it's very disgusting.
sadness,"When that feeling is high, then someone will definitely want to know anything related to the thing they are interested in. Well, here is the real role of respect. Our habit (because maybe I do too) likes to laugh at things that we think are funny but that is what other people want to be interested in."
anger,"[USERNAME] Hahaha, once or twice I can understand, especially if it's close. Oh well, if it's far away and like that all the time. You might consider to focus your phone instead of me."
sadness,"One of the worst things in my life is, when I don't immediately do the problem that I should do, I often do it, even though the wall clock keeps moving, delay, delay, delay, until you get old, delay the report."
love,"The beauty of falling in love is when the person we like, when we look at him smiling, he also smiles back at us."
love,"I really love Dede and Chuchu. I wait for their videos every day :"") Plus Dundun looks a bit like my cat, so I love him even more!"
anger,"Oh well, don't look at it. Or do you have a mental disorder like me? Those who already know don't like it, but just look at it. After all, his money is his money too. As long as her obligations as a wife and mother are not neglected, mah. I don't like him more because of several characteristics"
anger,"@username The government should be a servant of the people whose job is to make its people prosperous ....... Why is this ....... Ah never mind, let ALLAAH SWT give the punishment, soon, God willing. [URL]"
sadness,"Yes, yes, that's it, there's no need to be so sad"
anger,"I am not easily brought down by just words. A weak person who keeps complaining. If you want to bring me down, compete. When you are lazy, lazy, there are hundreds or even thousands of people out there who are trying to get rid of you."
anger,"[USERNAME] [USERNAME] No, why would you do that? Yesterday, people conducted a comparative study in America, the results are already visible, there will be a toll road with no obstacles."
anger,"Many people ask and offer, why don't you work in a bank? Why don't you apply to be a civil servant? Blablabla... the answer is simple, not interested and don't force it. Thank you...."
happy,"When he became the Governor of DKI Jakarta, his blusukan activities were followed by journalists because at that time it was considered something new and unique so that it was later known to the wider community. #Jokowi2Period"
sadness,"I don't need to be anyone. No need to be anyone. No need to be anything. I'm happy enough, I'm relieved enough and proud. Even though I'm just a speck of dust stuck to the NU flagpole that won't be wiped off until the end of the world. (KH. Munif Zuhri) #nahdlatululama"
love,Lie down with someone who feels like the comfort in this photo. Or my love for you. Eeaaaa #SorryStressEffects #LDREffects #HungryEffects Too [URL]
anger,Usually blame the implementer.
anger,"@USERNAME Elaah. Seriously, it's really annoying. Smart people never feel smart. If they feel smart, then they're not smart enough. Our job is to learn. So that we won't be like them."
anger,"I ask seriously, if [USERNAME] releases the debtor's name to the media, doesn't it violate Bank Indonesia's Regulation on customer confidentiality? [URL]"
anger,"My teacher used to be like this, he even cursed me for not getting a job. Oh well. If I wanted to retaliate, his sins would be reduced, right, honey? *eh"
