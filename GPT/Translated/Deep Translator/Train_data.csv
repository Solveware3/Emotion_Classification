fear,"[AskFM] Seriously asking, what time do cats wake up? I picked up a kitten on the street and hid it under a chair because I was afraid my mother would find out. I was afraid that tomorrow morning my mother would wake up and throw the kitten away."

anger,"Living in this day and age, if you just want to be called Ustadz, it's easy. Wearing Muslim clothes, wearing a white cap, especially a neat turban, daring to speak, memorizing a few translated verses, you are considered a preacher and without being called Ustadz, you don't need to stay in a boarding school for years."
happy,"Just imagining, later on graduation, a future boyfriend will come and give a gift with the caption ""future wife congratulations on graduating,"" while smiling happily. Oh God, I hope it comes true."
anger,"You guys are terrible, thinking that a girl and a boy who are best friends always get caught up in love."
anger,"To prevent radicalism, please describe the limits of radicalism first. If the limit is the criminalization of Islamic teachings, it is called Secular radicalism. [URL]"
sadness,"[USERNAME] [USERNAME] [USERNAME] Yes. Because the effects after speaking up are varied, and more people are falling for what I see now and that is actually eroding the mentality. Maybe those who say speak up are exaggerating etc. their mentality is mentally weak."
sadness,"But unfortunately, there is only one weakness. The price! Haha, the price hasn't been released yet, but if I look at the video, it's compared to the Huawei Porsche Design phone, which is more expensive than the iPhone X. I don't know whether that phone will sell or not in Indonesia."

love,"Having a husband who loves his family like Dad, loves Mom's family very much, like Dad who is loved very much by Mom's family, O Allah."
fear,"Eh, this is real, I've watched it, it's really scary. Originally, he didn't want to kill anyone, he was just falling in love. But until the end, he didn't know that his ignorance would turn into a disaster. HORROR WOY"
anger,"Of all the threads I've read, this thread is the weirdest in its writing. I swear it's so weird, I want to say it's over the top and make a thread, oh my. I'm not good at writing either, but my writing isn't as messy as your thread."
sadness,"When parents have said: son, in the future when you buy clothes, don't buy short-sleeved shirts like that anymore. Buy nice clothes that can be used for family events at home."

anger,"@username, the water in Kemanggisan has been off since the afternoon?? There is no information whatsoever, it has been reported that the system said there was no disruption but the water is off. Ah, it feels like living in a supernatural realm."
sadness,"Sometimes what you get and have now, there are others who want it too. Whatever it is. Because not all burdens can be borne by a gentleman. Early Morning Dialogue."
fear,"Damn it's scary. Just now when I was going home from the office because the distance from the office to my house by motorbike is about 50 minutes. Rather than being sleepy, I like to talk to myself or pretend to be chatting with someone (don't call me crazy, it's a medicine for drowsiness while driving).

fear,"This is it, sis. Nowadays, people are fond of digging up old sad tweets. Sometimes I'm afraid to speak up just because I think, ""Did any of my tweets from 2009 or 2010 or whatever hurt people?"""

anger,"Many also trivialize it with the sentence, ""Oh, you only do that, I do more. I'm used to it, why are you so over the top. Don't try to show off."" That's why many men are easy to do sexual harassment because many victims still keep silent and stay to think positive."
sadness,"Sometimes caring and giving excessive motivation hurts the heart. It seems like not accepting it, okay. Whatever. If you are disappointed, you will be very stupid. Seriously. Arrange it yourself."
sadness,"If you reject sincerity, do not reject it, because if you reject it, maybe he will just smile or nod his head silently, but in fact he is not angry but sad. If you make him sad, it will be difficult for sincerity to come."

love,"It turns out that ""you"" are the reason why I am willing to stay up late, until I rest late at night. Even though my eyes are starting to form dark circles, I don't care at all. Maybe my longing is too deep or you are the one who likes to fall asleep. Annoying, but I love you."

sadness,"iPhone 7 Plus, suddenly restarts itself, then sometimes bootloops and doesn't enter the system, it takes a long time to turn it off, then sometimes it can enter the system. Why, bruh?"
sadness,"""Hehe yeah, it still hurts, Fir -_-."""
anger,It seems like everyone is required to be a chameleon in this nowhere country. Is this a consequence of the presidential system of government but the implementation of the government system.

anger,"Your comment is so ridiculous, sis, just ignoring it because it's such a trivial matter. She's uncomfortable, so it's published to teach people who want to flirt not to continue their intentions if they don't want to be embarrassed. Reminder too."

anger,Still confused by people who say 2019 will change the president. I think it's fine as long as there is a candidate who is more qualified than Jokowi. But in reality there isn't one yet.
