fear,"I used to be confused about why people can have prolonged trauma, but now I realize after experiencing it myself, sometimes we don't speak up because we're afraid of being called exaggerated, lying, blah blah.

anger,"You insulting him is the same as letting sexual harassment run rampant. Stupid. Being harassed and then being told to be angry, reject, and curse, it doesn't work for the perpetrator of sexual harassment. What Via Vallen did affected Simic's career? Well, that's the risk, Simic, stupid."
anger,"Can't sleep! Too lazy to unpack, sleeping in jeans, hoping for morning soon."
